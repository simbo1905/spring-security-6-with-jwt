# spring-security-6-with-jwt

This can only run on Java 17 not Java 22.

This was created to follow along with the video tutorial [Issue & Validate JWT Tokens Login In Spring Security 6 From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrAIs7tSgks)

Rather than running postgres it has been converted to use in-memory H2.

Note that you have to use something postman as per the video tutorial to test the endpoints.
